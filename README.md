# English-dictionary

In the project, we design and implement a client-server dictionary application, in which a multi-threaded server allows concurrent clients to search the meaning of a word, add a new word, and remove an existing word. The application is mainly implemented by the use of two fundamental technologies, Sockets and Threads, serving as the abstraction for network communication and concurrency. The server-end can allow that multiple clients connect to server concurrently and server processes multiple requests and operates concurrently.
